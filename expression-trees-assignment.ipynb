    "# Programming Assignment #3: Expression Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression tree is a tree where internal nodes are operators and the leaves are either variables or constants. For example, here is an expression tree that corresponds to the expression `2-3*x`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (MINUS 2 (TIMES 3 x))\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will \n",
    "1. Write an evaluator for expression trees, e.g., the value of the tree above is `-28` when `x=10`.\n",
    "2. Perform some simple optimizations, e.g., `(MINUS 2 (TIMES (PLUS 1 2) x))` simplifies to the expression above.\n",
    "3. Show that the optimizations are correct, i.e., that they return the same values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: You may know that the Java/C++/C#/whatever compiler you use **optimizes** the generated code. In this assignment you will get a feel for what an optimizing compiler does. Coincidentally, the next section introduces the ACL2 `LET*` syntax, and that turns out to be very similar to a code represerntation called *static single assignment (SSA)* that is often used in compilers for optimization. You can learn more about this if you take the compilers course!\n"

    "## Introducing LET*\n",
    "\n",
    "You do **not** have to use `LET*` to do this assignment, but `LET*` is a nice feature that can make it easier to write some of the functions below. Here's how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to write a complicated expression, like\n",
    "\n",
    "    (+ (* 2 3)\n",
    "       (* 2 3))\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the same term appears twice? `LET*` is simply a way to create a \"temporary variable\" that has a value and can them be used freely. To be clear, these are **not** variables in the Java or C++ sense, since they can never be changed. It's really just a way to name a value that appears more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression above can be written using `LET*` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (LET* ((x (* 2 3))\n",
    "           )\n",
    "          (+ x x))\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the common subexpression `(* 2 3)` is given the name `x`. You can define more than one variable. For example,\n",
    "consider this expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (+ (* 2 (+ 2 1))\n",
    "       (* 2 (+ 2 1)))\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be written using `LET*` as\n",
    "\n",
    "    (LET* ((y (+ 2 1))\n",
    "           (x (* 2 y))\n",
    "           )\n",
    "          (+ x x))\n",
    "\n",
    "It's up to you whether to use `LET*` or just ignore it. I used it in some of the definitions and not in others, just to convince myself that you could do either."

    "We have two different optimizations now, so you can think of building a full-fledged optimizer by running `fold-constants` and then `remove-plus-0`. Or should it be first `remove-plus-0` and then `fold-constants`?\n",
    "\n",
    "As things stand, `fold-constants` may produce a 0 that can then be removed by `remove-plus-0`, but there's no way for `remove-plus-0` to start with a non-constant expression and return a constant expression that `fold-constants` can work with. In other words, folding constants first, then removing zeros is the best strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's think about adding some more optimizations, for example `(MINUS x x)` is the same as 0, right? This optimization can create a 0 that can then be removed by `remove-plus-0` or folded into another constant by `fold-constants`. Then again, we may need to run `remove-plus-0` to realize that two arguments to `MINUS` are the same! So in fact, there is no optimal ordering here, and a good optimizing compiler will keep trying the different optimizations until the expression is as optimized as it can get.\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't ask you to build the global optimizer that keeps trying all the little optimizations until it's done, but I will give you the opportunity to try out some more local optimizations for extra credit. \n",

    "* ...\n",
